The easiest way to play around (assuming `npm` and `node.js` installed):
```
npx serve
```

it will start a local server, and the content (namely, index page and all related scripts) will be available on
`http://localhost:3000`

> Currently, `serve` package has some issues running at the latest version (14), so need to run
> ```npx -p serve@13 serve``` instead
